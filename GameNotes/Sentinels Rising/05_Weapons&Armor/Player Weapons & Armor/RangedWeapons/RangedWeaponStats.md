Ranged Damage: 
To interface this system with a ranged weapon system, you would need to assign a base damage value to each ranged weapon in the game. Let's say we have a basic bow that has a base damage of 5.

Then, when a player uses the pistol to attack an enemy, the damage dealt would be calculated using the ranged damage formula we established earlier, which is:

ranged damage = base damage x (ranged accuracy / 10)

So for the basic pistol with a base damage of 5 and a character with a ranged accuracy of 6, the damage dealt would be:

ranged damage = 5 x (6 / 10)
ranged damage = 3

Basic Pistol is 9 shots = 9x3 = 27 base damage.

So the character would deal 3 damage to the enemy with the basic pistol.

Most shots come quickly from ranged weapons, therefore numbers will be lower in single shots.
