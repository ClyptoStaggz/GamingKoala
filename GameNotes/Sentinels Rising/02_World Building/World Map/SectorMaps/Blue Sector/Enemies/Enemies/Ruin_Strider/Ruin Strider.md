Ruin Strider:

Size: Large, comparable to a Brute Wyvern in Monster Hunter.

The Ruin Strider, a formidable predator, roams the overgrown structures with a primal ferocity. Its sturdy reptilian frame is encased in formidable armored plates, providing both protection and a menacing appearance. Sharp claws and fangs adorn its body, designed for rending through resilient vegetation and the flesh of its prey and adversaries.

The Strider's eyes emit an eerie luminescence, a haunting glow that pierces through the darkness of its habitat. This enhanced vision aids the creature in tracking down targets with precision, allowing it to strike swiftly and efficiently.

Abilities:

1. Rending Swipe: The Ruin Strider utilizes its powerful claws to deliver slashing strikes, rending through both organic and inanimate matter. This attack can tear through vegetation, cripple opponents, and inflict severe damage.
2. Armor Plating: The creature's thick armored plates provide exceptional defense against physical attacks, reducing the effectiveness of enemy strikes and granting it increased resilience in battle.
3. Shadow Stalker: The Ruin Strider possesses the ability to blend seamlessly with shadows, granting it enhanced stealth and making it more challenging for adversaries to detect its presence until it strikes.
4. Venomous Bite: The Strider's fangs are equipped with potent venom, capable of immobilizing prey or weakening rival creatures over time. A single bite can deliver a paralyzing toxin or sap the strength of opponents.

As an AI-controlled monster, the Ruin Strider would exhibit behavior such as utilizing hit-and-run tactics, ambushing targets from the cover of shadows, and employing its rending claws and venomous bite to weaken and disable foes. The AI would also need to be programmed to assess threats and prioritize targets, considering its defensive capabilities and utilizing evasive maneuvers when necessary.
