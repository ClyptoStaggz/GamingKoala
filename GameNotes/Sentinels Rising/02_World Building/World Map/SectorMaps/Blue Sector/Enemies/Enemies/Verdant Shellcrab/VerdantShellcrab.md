Name and Description
	The Verdant Shellcrab, a colossal crustacean-like creature, has claimed dominion over the overgrown structures. Its elongated body is protected by a formidable exoskeleton resembling intricately patterned shells and armored plating. Covered in moss and tangled vines, it seamlessly blends into its lush surroundings. The Shellcrab wields massive, serrated pincers capable of tearing through vegetation and rending its prey with crushing force.
Archetype
	Turtle: High Reconstruction and Tenacity, moderate Musculature, low Kinematics and Potential. This archetype is slow but incredibly durable, able to withstand huge amounts of damage while slowly wearing down enemies. 
Habitat and Distribution
	The VSC has made its home in sinking structures left behind from the Arkai. Everything has a thin layer of moss and the crab itself camouflages itself in the massive amounts of vegetation. Some would say the home of the Shellcrab looks like a sea of tangled moss and vines.
Behavior and Ecology
	Herbivorous
	The shellcrab is constantly eating the many microorganisms that dwell within its habitat. It generally tries to expand its habitat at the same time it crumbles and decays, constantly building small towered structures to support its manic lifestyle.
Abilities
	***Mossy Carapace***: The Verdant Shellcrab's exoskeleton is camouflaged with moss and foliage, allowing it to blend seamlessly into its environment and remain concealed until the perfect moment to strike.
	***Crushing Claws***: Its colossal pincers are its most fearsome weapon. With brute strength, the Shellcrab can deliver bone-crushing blows, capable of shattering rocks and piercing through the toughest defenses.
	***Toxic Vines***: The creature's moss-covered carapace also conceals venomous vines, which it can launch at prey or enemies. These vines ensnare and poison opponents, sapping their strength and impairing their movements.
	***Shattering Assault***: Utilizing its robust exoskeleton and powerful limbs, the Shellcrab performs a devastating charge, smashing through obstacles, walls, and even rival creatures, causing widespread destruction and disorienting its adversaries.
AI Behavior
	As an AI-controlled monster, the Verdant Shellcrab would exhibit behavior such as utilizing its mossy carapace to lie in ambush, waiting for unsuspecting prey or intruders. It would strategically employ its crushing claws to disable and dismantle adversaries, utilizing its immense strength to overpower and crush them. The Shellcrab would also utilize its toxic vines to hinder and weaken foes, setting up opportunities for devastating attacks. The AI would need to be programmed to assess threats, exploit its natural defenses, and unleash devastating assaults while capitalizing on the environment to create engaging and challenging encounters.
