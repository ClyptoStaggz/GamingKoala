Description
	The Xenolith Colossus is an awe-inspiring amalgamation of an otherworldly golem and an ancient alien beetle. Its colossal form is a fusion of extraterrestrial alloys and chitinous plating, seamlessly blending with the overgrown structures. Rising above the landscape, it emanates an aura of enigmatic power and technological marvels.
Archetype
	Bruiser - high musculature and potential, average kinematics and tenacity, low reconstruction. This archetype is a melee attacker that hits hard and has powerful abilities, but is vulnerable to damage and lacks the ability to regenerate quickly. 
Habitat and Distribution
	The XC dwells within areas of great ore deposits. It makes its home at birth within the ground and spends the majority of its life drawing energy and releasing it into the surrounding area. Throughout its life, it will harden and continuously size up and reinforce its plating. In doing so, the XC typically are found in places with large amounts of hardened materials that are vast enough for it to continue growing, much like a hermit crab or a cicada.
Behavior and Ecology
	This creature rarely comes out of the ground but when it does, it throws a fit and starts to demolish its own home, destroying any living creature that has made its home on or around it. The XC will hurl large boulders and only let up after a ***Crystal Aegis*** as this takes a lot of energy to be accomplished.
Abilities
	***Golem Charge***: The Xenolith Colossus charges forward with earth-shaking force, utilizing its immense strength and beetle-inspired appendages to trample and crush foes, inflicting devastating damage upon impact.
	***Vein Shatter***: It unleashes a concentrated surge of energy through its intricate circuitry, generating seismic shockwaves that fracture the ground beneath. These shockwaves travel through the earth, stunning and disorienting nearby adversaries.
    ***Crystal Aegis***: The Xenolith Colossus activates an impenetrable shield forged from alien crystals, encasing itself in an ethereal barrier. This protective shield absorbs incoming attacks, reflecting some back at assailants and granting temporary invulnerability.
    ***Cosmic Resonance***: Channeling its connection to celestial energies, the Xenolith Colossus taps into the very fabric of the universe, amplifying its power. It radiates a pulsating aura that empowers nearby allies, enhancing their speed, strength, and regenerative capabilities for a limited duration.
AI Behavior
	As the AI programmer, you have the task of designing behavioral algorithms for the Xenolith Colossus. This could involve strategic utilization of its charge attack to engage enemies, calculated employment of Vein Shatter to disrupt enemy formations, intelligent activation of Crystal Aegis to withstand onslaughts, and timed employment of Cosmic Resonance to provide a significant boost to allies. Balancing offensive and defensive maneuvers will be crucial in harnessing the immense power of the Xenolith Colossus on the battlefield.
