Name and Description
	A colossal Mothra-like creature, emerges from the shadows. Its towering form combines elegance and strength. Adorned with moss and armored plates, it blends seamlessly with the overgrown structures. Scythe-like mandibles protrude from its head, ready to slice through vegetation and fend off threats.
Archetype
	Ability cannon: High potential, low musculature, reconstruction, tenacity, and kinematics. This archetype is capable of dealing massive damage quickly, but is very vulnerable and must rely on mobility and positioning to survive. 
Habitat and Distribution
	The Mossback Guardian nestles within tree-domed areas illuminated by bioluminescent flowers. These flowers provide not only nutrients to the MBG but also sustain a delicate ecosystem of small creatures. The soft glow of the flowers casts an ethereal light, creating an enchanting atmosphere within the guardian's domain. This secluded and mystical habitat can be found deep within the forests of the blue sector.
Behavior and Ecology
	*Saprophagous*
	They spend seasons just collecting nutrients in order to survive in harsher seasons due to weather. They hibernate just as bears do and once the warmer seasons start up, they use the excess amount of nutrients and energy to lay eggs. They then patrol and act as guardians to their babies in order to produce more of its kind using the process known as parthenogenesis. Very rarely a male is produced and metamorphosizes into a gnarly version of the MBG. 
Abilities
	***Mossy Camouflage***: The Mossback Guardian can blend with its surroundings, utilizing its dense moss and natural armor to become nearly invisible, providing a significant advantage in ambushing prey or eluding danger.
	***Wing Gust***: With a mighty beat of its wings, the creature generates powerful gusts of wind, capable of knocking down opponents, dispersing projectiles, and disrupting enemy attacks. 
	***Toxic Spores***: The Mossback Guardian releases a cloud of toxic spores from its body, poisoning foes and weakening their defenses over time.
	***Earthen Tremor***: Utilizing its immense size and strength, the creature slams its massive body into the ground, causing a localized earthquake that disorients and damages nearby adversaries.
AI Behavior
	As a monster hunter monster, the AI programming for the Mossback Guardian would involve behavior such as strategizing to capitalize on its camouflage, utilizing aerial attacks with its wings, releasing toxic spores to gradually weaken foes, and employing devastating ground-based tremors to disrupt opponents and create openings for further attacks. The AI would also need to consider defensive maneuvers, such as using Wing Gust to deflect incoming projectiles or creating distance from dangerous situations.
