Musculature (str) : This attribute is on a scale of 0-11, where 0 represents a character with very little physical strength and 11 represents a character who can lift massive weights and deal devastating blows.

Kinematics (dex) : This attribute is on a scale of 0-11, where 0 represents a character who is slow, clumsy, and not very agile, and 11 represents a character who is incredibly fast, agile, and capable of impressive acrobatics.

Reconstruction (regeneration): This attribute is on a scale of 0-11 as well, where 0 represents a character who takes a long time to recover from injuries and 11 represents a character who regenerates health and shields very quickly.

Tenacity (toughness) : This attribute is on a scale of 0-11, where 0 represents a character who can't take much damage and 11 represents a character who is very difficult to take down.

Potential (Ability Stat): This attribute is on a scale of 0-11 as well, where 0 represents a character whose abilities are not very effective and 11 represents a character whose abilities are incredibly powerful.

Stats will be 0-11 or 12 'notches' on the player UI. These will be modifiers to base stats (Ranged or Melee) to within combat. The average starting player will be 3 on this scale. They will have 22 pts. to create their character from. 

Character Creation Rules. Players will have 3 base value, and the ability to adjust stats upto 7 more points. 

    # # # # # # # # # # # #    - pts. avail. 7

Pot * * * 


The average character starts with 3 points in each attribute, and has an additional 7 points to allocate at character creation, that means the character can have up to 10 points in any given attribute, since 3 + 7 = 10.

This gives the player some flexibility in creating their character, allowing them to specialize in one or two attributes while still having a decent amount of competency in the others. It's also worth noting that characters who focus heavily on one attribute may be more vulnerable in other areas, so there's a trade-off to consider.

***Health: This sub-attribute represents how much damage the character can take before they are incapacitated. You could give the character a base amount of health determined by their musculature and tenacity stats, and then add more health based on their level and any equipment or abilities they have. Health could be measured in hit points (HP). 

HP Calculations: 

- Start with a base health value of 20, representing the character's starting health.

- Add 1 health point for every 2 points of musculature, representing the character's raw physical power and ability to take damage. So a character with 4 musculature would have an additional 2 health points, for a total of 22.

- Multiply the character's base health by a factor based on their tenacity skill. For example, you could multiply base health by (1 + (tenacity / 20)), meaning that a character with 6 points in tenacity would have a 15% bonus to their base health, while a character with 10 points in tenacity would have a 25% bonus to their base health.

--Example Basis - So a character with 3 points in each attribute and 4 points in tenacity would have a base health value of 20, and could potentially have up to 6 additional health points from musculature (assuming they put all 7 of their remaining points into musculature). However, their actual health value would be increased by the tenacity bonus, so if we assume they have a base health value of 20, then their actual health value would be 25 (20 x 1.25). 

+++++++++++
***Stamina: This sub-attribute represents how much physical exertion the character can endure before becoming fatigued. You could give the character a base amount of stamina determined by their musculature and kinematics stats, and then add more stamina based on their level and any equipment or abilities they have. Stamina could be measured in stamina points (SP). Will need to ensure that there is a physical representation on the player for this, but not conflicting with the HP display system.  Do not overload the player with visual vomit. 

Stamina Calculations: 

- Start with a base stamina value of 10, representing the character's starting endurance.

- Add 1 stamina point for every 2 points of kinematics, representing the character's agility and mobility. So a character with 4 kinematics would get an additional 2 stamina points, for a total of 12.

- Add 1 stamina point for every 2 points of musculature, representing the character's physical power and stamina. So a character with 4 musculature would get an additional 2 stamina points, for a total of 14.

- Add bonus stamina points from equipment or abilities.

- Multiply the character's base stamina by a factor based on their reconstruction skill. For example, you could multiply base stamina by (1 + (reconstruction / 10)), meaning that a character with 6 points in reconstruction would have a 20% bonus to their base stamina, while a character with 10 points in reconstruction would have a 50% bonus to their base stamina.


--Example Basis - So a character with 3 points in each attribute and 4 points in reconstruction would have a base stamina value of 10, and could potentially have up to 14 stamina points at character creation (assuming they put 4 points into both kinematics and musculature, and didn't allocate any points elsewhere). However, their actual stamina pool would be increased by the reconstruction bonus, so if we assume they have a base stamina of 10, then their actual stamina pool would be 15 (10 x 1.5).


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Aenima pool: This sub-attribute represents the character's ability to use special abilities or powers. The Aenima pool could be based on the character's potential stat, and could be used to cast spells, activate abilities, or perform other special actions. The Aenima pool could be measured in Aenima points (AP).

- Start with a base Aenima pool value of 10, representing the character's starting energy reserve.

- Add 1 Aenima point for every 2 points of potential, representing the character's ability to harness their abilities and deal damage. 

- So a character with 4 potential would get an additional 2 Aenima points, for a total of 12.

- Add bonus Aenima points from equipment or abilities.

- Multiply the character's base Aenima pool by a factor based on their kinematics skill. For example, you could multiply base Aenima pool by (1 + (kinematics / 10)), meaning that a character with 6 points in kinematics would have a 20% bonus to their base Aenima pool, while a character with 10 points in kinematics would have a 50% bonus to their base Aenima pool.
So a character with 3 points in each attribute and 4 points in potential would have a base Aenima pool value of 10, and could potentially have up to 12 Aenima points at character creation (assuming they put all 7 of their remaining points into potential). However, their actual Aenima pool would be increased by the kinematics bonus, so if we assume they have a base Aenima pool of 10, then their actual Aenima pool would be 15 (10 x 1.5).


The formula for base melee damage would be:

base melee damage = musculature stat value * 2

So for a player with a musculature stat of 3, their melee damage would be:

base melee damage = 3 * 2
base melee damage = 6

to calculate damage mitigation using the tenacity stat could be to use a simple percentage reduction formula. For example, you could use:

damage taken = incoming damage * (1 - (0.05 * tenacity stat value))

So for a player with a tenacity stat of 3 and an incoming damage of 20, their damage taken would be:

damage taken = 20 * (1 - (0.05 * 3)) damage taken = 18

This means that the player would only take 18 points of damage instead of the full 20 points due to their tenacity stat reducing the damage by 10%.

Ranged Damage: 

To interface this system with a ranged weapon system, you would need to assign a base damage value to each ranged weapon in the game. Let's say we have a basic bow that has a base damage of 5.

Then, when a player uses the pistol to attack an enemy, the damage dealt would be calculated using the ranged damage formula we established earlier, which is:

ranged damage = base damage x (ranged accuracy / 10)

So for the basic pistol with a base damage of 5 and a character with a ranged accuracy of 6, the damage dealt would be:

ranged damage = 5 x (6 / 10)
ranged damage = 3

Basic Pistol is 9 shots = 9x3 = 27 base damage.

So the character would deal 3 damage to the enemy with the basic pistol.

Most shots come quickly from ranged weapons, therefore numbers will be lower in single shots. 

********************WEAPONS*****************

Weapons are divided into four tiers, with tier 4 being the highest and tier 1 being the lowest.
Tier 1 weapons have minimum values for all stats, while tier 4 weapons have maximum values for all stats.
Each tier has a probability of having certain number of talents: tier 2 has a low probability of having 1 talent, tier 3 has a medium probability of having 1 talent and a low probability of having 2 talents, and tier 4 has a high probability of having 2 talents.
Only tier 2, 3, and 4 weapons can have talents.
The talents are randomly generated from a predefined list.
The damage stat is a range.
All other stats are single values.
Weapons are generated with singular values from the tier tables, and cannot have maximum values below tier 4.

sword and shield, bladed tonfas, Meteor hammer, cleaver, spear, and  escrima sticks. 

Stats on these weapons are:  Damage, Critical %, Critical Damage, Parry Chance, Swing Speed

Here are some example calculations for melee attacks using the sword and shield:

Musculature = 3
Kinematics = 3
Attack Multiplier = (Musculature + Kinematics) / 2 = 3

Total Damage = 6 + (3 * 3) = 15

For the talents, the probabilities are:

Tier 2: 20% chance of 1 talent
Tier 3: 10% chance of 1 talent, 2% chance of 2 talents
Tier 4: 30% chance of 1 talent, 20% chance of 2 talents.

mitigation into ranged damage could be to reduce the damage based on the distance between the attacker and the target. This would represent the difficulty of hitting a moving target from a distance and give the target a chance to dodge or avoid the attack.

For example, you could have a formula like:

distance modifier = 1 - (distance / maximum range) ranged damage taken = ranged damage * distance modifier * (1 - (0.05 * tenacity))

Where "distance" is the distance between the attacker and target, "maximum range" is the maximum range of the ranged weapon, and "tenacity" is the target's tenacity stat. The distance modifier reduces the ranged damage taken based on the distance, and the tenacity modifier reduces the damage further based on the target's tenacity stat.

So, for instance, if the maximum range of the ranged weapon is 20 meters, and the attacker is 10 meters away from the target, the distance modifier would be:

distance modifier = 1 - (10 / 20) distance modifier = 0.5

If the ranged damage was 15, and the target had a tenacity of 6, the damage taken would be:

ranged damage taken = 15 * 0.5 * (1 - (0.05 * 6)) ranged damage taken = 15 * 0.5 * 0.7 ranged damage taken = 5.25

So in this case, the target would take 5.25 points of damage from the ranged attack.
