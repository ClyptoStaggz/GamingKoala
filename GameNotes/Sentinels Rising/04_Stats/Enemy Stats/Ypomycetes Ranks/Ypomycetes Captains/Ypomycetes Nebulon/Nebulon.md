2.  Description: Nebulon is a cunning general who wields the power of spores, creating thick clouds that shroud the battlefield. These clouds obscure vision, making it difficult for enemies to see and breathe. Additionally, Sporos Nebulon utilizes his spores to disorient enemies, weakening their resolve and impairing their combat effectiveness.
    
3.  Abilities:
    
    a. Spore Veil: Nebulon releases dense clouds of spores, enveloping the battlefield in a thick mist. This mist drastically reduces visibility, making it challenging for enemies to accurately target or detect allies. The spore veil also hampers ranged attacks and disrupts enemy spellcasting, creating an advantageous environment for Sporos Nebulon and his forces.
    
    b. Disorienting Spores: Nebulon can release specialized spores that disorient enemies within their vicinity. These spores cause confusion, impairing the cognitive functions of affected targets. Disoriented enemies may experience dizziness, slowed reaction times, and difficulty coordinating their actions, weakening their combat effectiveness.
    
    c. Toxic Emanation: Nebulon can infuse his spores with toxic substances, releasing a noxious cloud that damages enemies over time. The toxic emanation affects those who remain within its range, gradually sapping their health and reducing their stamina. This ability forces enemies to either endure the toxic effects or retreat from the affected area.
    
    d. Spore Manipulation: Nebulon possesses the ability to manipulate and direct the movement of his spores. He can guide the spores to follow specific paths, redirecting their trajectory to create unpredictable patterns. This manipulation allows him to target specific areas or individuals, maximizing the disorienting and debilitating effects of his spore-based abilities.
    
    e. Resolve Weakening: Nebulon's spores have a psychological impact on enemies, sowing doubt and eroding their resolve. The presence of the spore clouds and the disorienting effects make it difficult for enemies to maintain focus and determination. This ability weakens their will to fight, reducing their combat effectiveness and making them more susceptible to surrender or retreat.
    
4.  Tactics: Nebulon is a strategic and elusive enemy who capitalizes on the disorienting and debilitating effects of his spores. He strategically creates spore clouds to obscure vision, disrupt enemy coordination, and weaken their combat effectiveness. Sporos Nebulon prefers hit-and-run tactics, utilizing the confusion caused by the spore clouds to disorient enemies before launching targeted strikes from concealed positions.
