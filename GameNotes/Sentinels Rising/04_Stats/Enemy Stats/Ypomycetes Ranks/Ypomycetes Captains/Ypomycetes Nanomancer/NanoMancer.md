2.  Description: Nanomancer is a formidable captain who possesses the power to control and manipulate a vast swarm of nanobots. These microscopic machines respond to his commands, allowing him to unleash devastating attacks and deploy intricate defensive strategies.
    
3.  Abilities:
    
    a. Nanobot Swarm: Nanomancer commands a massive swarm of nanobots that can infiltrate enemies, disrupt their systems, and inflict damage. The nanobots can be unleashed in various ways, such as forming sharp blades, creating shields, or enveloping targets to drain their energy.
    
    b. Nanobot Manipulation: Nanomancer has the ability to shape and control the behavior of the nanobots in real-time. He can reconfigure them into offensive or defensive formations, adapting to the situation on the battlefield. For example, he can form a protective shield to deflect incoming attacks or reassemble the nanobots into piercing projectiles.
    
    c. Nanobotic Assault: Nanomancer can unleash a concentrated assault by directing the nanobots to swarm a single target, overwhelming it with a flurry of microscopic attacks. This ability deals significant damage to a specific enemy, exploiting vulnerabilities and weakening their defenses.
    
    d. Nano Shielding: Nanomancer can deploy a defensive shield composed of his nanobot swarm. This shield provides protection against incoming projectiles and reduces the effectiveness of melee attacks. It can be reinforced or repositioned as needed, offering him strategic advantages on the battlefield.
    
    e. Nanobot Reconstruction: If Nanomancer sustains damage, he can utilize his nanobots to repair his body or regenerate lost armor. This ability allows him to adapt and continue fighting, making him a resilient adversary that requires persistent effort to defeat.
    
4.  Tactics: Nanomancer is a calculated and tactical enemy who uses his swarm of nanobots to his advantage. He strategically deploys the nanobots to disrupt enemy defenses, disable equipment, and exploit weaknesses. He can quickly shift between offense and defense, adapting his tactics based on the situation. Nanomancer prefers mid-range combat, utilizing the range of his nanobotic attacks while maintaining a defensive posture with his shield.
