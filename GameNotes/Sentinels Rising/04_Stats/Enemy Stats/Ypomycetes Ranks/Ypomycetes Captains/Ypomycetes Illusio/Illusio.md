1.  Illusio (Illusio meaning "illusion" or "deception" in Latin)
    
2.  Description: Illusio is a cunning and elusive leader who specializes in the art of deception. With the Mirror Image ability at their disposal, they can create convincing duplicates of themselves to confuse and divert enemy forces, gaining a strategic advantage on the battlefield.
    
3.  Abilities:
    
    a. Mirror Image: Illusio can create a perfect duplicate of themselves using advanced holographic technology. The duplicate appears identical to Illusio, mimicking their appearance and movement. Once activated, the duplicate runs in the targeted direction, drawing enemy fire and diverting attention away from the player.
    
    b. Deceptive Tactics: Illusio is a master of misdirection and uses their Mirror Image ability in combination with other deceptive tactics. They can strategically time the activation of the mirror image to coincide with sudden movements, making it even more challenging for enemies to discern the real captain's location.
    
    c. Tactical Retreat: When facing overwhelming odds or needing to reposition, Illusio can use their Mirror Image ability as a tactical retreat. They can activate the duplicate and make it appear as if they are retreating, effectively luring enemies away from the real captain and creating an opportunity for escape or regrouping.
    
    d. Illusionary Strikes: Illusio can exploit the confusion caused by their mirror image to launch surprise attacks. They can coordinate their actions with the duplicate, making it appear as if both the captain and the duplicate are attacking simultaneously from different angles, disorienting and overwhelming enemies.
    
    e. Holographic Distortion: Illusio can manipulate holographic projections to create visual distortions and illusions on the battlefield. This ability further enhances their deception, making it difficult for enemies to accurately target the captain or their mirror image.
    
4.  Tactics: Illusio excels in hit-and-run tactics, employing misdirection and confusion to gain the upper hand. They strategically deploy their mirror image to draw enemy attention and create openings for themselves or their allies. Illusio relies on speed, agility, and precise timing to maximize the effectiveness of their illusions and to stay one step ahead of their opponents.
