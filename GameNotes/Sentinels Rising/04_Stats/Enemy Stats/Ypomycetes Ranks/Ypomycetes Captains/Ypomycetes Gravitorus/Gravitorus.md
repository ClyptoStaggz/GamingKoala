2.  Description: Gravitorus is a formidable general who harnesses the power of gravity. This enemy has the unique ability to create a powerful gravitational field, allowing them to absorb kinetic damage and repulse it back at their opponents. They can manipulate gravity to control the battlefield, pulling enemies towards them or pushing them away, and immobilizing foes to make them vulnerable to attacks from their forces.
    
3.  Abilities:
    
    a. Kinetic Absorption: Gravitorus possesses an advanced suit or innate ability that enables them to absorb and dissipate kinetic energy. This ability allows them to mitigate damage from physical impacts, bullets, or explosive attacks. The absorbed energy can be stored and later released as a devastating force against their enemies.
    
    b. Gravitational Field: Gravitorus can create a powerful gravitational field around themselves. They can manipulate this field to pull enemies towards them, disrupting their movement and positioning. Alternatively, they can push enemies away, creating a defensive barrier or forcing opponents into unfavorable positions.
    
    c. Gravitational Repulsion: By manipulating gravity, Gravitorus can repulse incoming projectiles or melee attacks, deflecting them away from their body. This ability allows them to redirect attacks back at their foes or create a protective shield against incoming fire.
    
    d. Gravity Imprisonment: Gravitorus can harness gravity to immobilize enemies, temporarily trapping them in a localized gravitational prison. This ability renders foes unable to move or defend themselves effectively, leaving them vulnerable to attacks from Gravitorus Galactica's forces.
    
    e. Gravity Well: Gravitorus can create localized gravitational wells at specific locations on the battlefield. These wells distort space and time, affecting the movement of both enemies and objects within their radius. They can be strategically placed to control the flow of battle, trap enemies, or disrupt enemy formations.
    
4.  Tactics: Gravitorus is a formidable enemy that combines defensive capabilities with strategic manipulation of gravity. They absorb kinetic damage to mitigate harm while utilizing their gravitational powers to control the battlefield. Gravitorus prefers a calculated approach, drawing enemies into their gravitational field, and then unleashing devastating attacks or allowing their forces to overwhelm immobilized foes.

Player Acquired Ability :   [[Kinectic Absorption]]

Archetype: Glass Cannon: High Kinematics and Potential, low Musculature and Tenacity, moderate Reconstruction. This archetype is incredibly agile and can deal devastating damage from a distance, but is easily taken down by even minor attacks.
