2.  Description: Umbra is a cunning general who possesses the ability to manipulate shadows, using them to create illusions and deceive enemies. With their shadow powers, Umbra can trick foes into attacking their own allies, sow confusion on the battlefield, and employ teleportation to evade attacks with unparalleled agility.
    
3.  Abilities:
    
    a. Shadow Illusions: Umbra can manipulate shadows to create lifelike illusions. These illusions can take the form of enemy combatants, allies, or even the general themselves. The illusions are visually convincing and can deceive enemies into targeting their own allies, causing chaos and turning the tide of battle in Umbra's favor.
    
    b. Betrayal Shadows: Umbra can infuse shadows with a touch of malevolence, turning them into semi-sentient entities that can betray enemies. These betrayal shadows latch onto enemies, distorting their perception and goading them into attacking their own allies. The shadows sow discord among enemies, breaking their formations and disrupting their cooperation.
    
    c. Shadow Teleportation: Umbra can merge with the shadows, instantly teleporting short distances across the battlefield. This teleportation ability allows them to swiftly reposition themselves, evade attacks, and surprise enemies from unexpected angles. It provides them with unparalleled agility and the ability to strike swiftly and disappear just as quickly.
    
    d. Cloak of Shadows: Umbra can shroud themselves in an impenetrable cloak of shadows, rendering them nearly invisible and granting them enhanced stealth. While in this state, they become incredibly difficult to detect and target, allowing them to move freely amidst enemies without being noticed. This ability enables them to gather intelligence, scout enemy positions, and strike with precision.
    
    e. Umbral Embrace: Umbra can temporarily meld with the shadows, becoming intangible and impervious to physical attacks. While in this state, they are immune to damage, allowing them to pass through enemies and obstacles unharmed. This ability grants them a short period of invulnerability, providing a crucial window for strategic repositioning or escape.
    
4.  Tactics: Umbra is a master of deception and subterfuge, utilizing their shadow manipulation abilities to sow chaos and confusion on the battlefield. They strategically create illusions and betrayal shadows, tricking enemies into attacking their own allies and disrupting their coordination. Umbra Obscurus excels in hit-and-run tactics, utilizing shadow teleportation and their cloaking abilities to strike swiftly and vanish before enemies can mount a counterattack.
