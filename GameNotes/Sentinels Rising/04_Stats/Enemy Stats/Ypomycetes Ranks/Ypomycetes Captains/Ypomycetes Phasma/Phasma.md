 2.  Description: Phasma is an enigmatic general who possesses the power to phase through solid objects, rendering them intangible and difficult to contain. Their ghostly abilities instill fear in enemies, weakening their morale and disrupting their combat effectiveness.
    
3.  Abilities:
    
    a. Ethereal Phase: Phasma can become intangible, allowing them to phase through solid objects and pass through barriers. While in this ethereal state, they are impervious to physical attacks and can move freely through obstacles, rendering attempts to contain them ineffective. Phasma can use their phasing ability strategically to outmaneuver enemies and escape unfavorable situations.
    
    b. Terrifying Presence: Phasma emanates an aura of supernatural dread that instills fear in enemies. Merely being in their presence can weaken the morale of foes, making them more susceptible to intimidation and reducing their combat effectiveness. The aura of fear can cause enemies to hesitate, make mistakes, or even flee from the battlefield.
    
    c. Haunting Specters: Phasma can summon spectral apparitions that haunt enemies and create psychological distress. These haunting specters can take various forms, from ghostly warriors to nightmarish creatures, and they relentlessly pursue enemies, causing panic and confusion. The presence of these specters hampers enemy movements, impairing their coordination and making them more vulnerable to attacks.
    
    d. Ghostly Retribution: When Phasma is struck by enemies while in their intangible state, they can channel the energy of the attack and unleash a ghostly retaliation. The ghostly retribution damages enemies in proximity to Phasma, punishing them for their aggression and discouraging further direct assaults. This ability adds a layer of risk for enemies who attempt to engage Phasma directly.
    
    e. Shadowmeld: Phasma can merge with the shadows, becoming nearly invisible and undetectable. While in this state, they can observe enemies and gather intelligence without being noticed. The shadowmeld ability grants them enhanced stealth, allowing them to plan their next move or launch surprise attacks from concealed positions.
    
4.  Tactics: Phasma is a mysterious and elusive enemy who excels in psychological warfare. They utilize their intangibility to phase through obstacles, rendering containment efforts futile. Phasma's terrifying presence weakens enemy morale, creating openings for their spectral apparitions to sow panic and disrupt enemy coordination. They employ hit-and-fade tactics, striking swiftly before vanishing into the shadows, leaving enemies unnerved and uncertain.
