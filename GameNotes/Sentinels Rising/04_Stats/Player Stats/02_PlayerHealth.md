Health: This sub-attribute represents how much damage the character can take before they are incapacitated. You could give the character a base amount of health determined by their musculature and tenacity stats, and then add more health based on their level and any equipment or abilities they have. Health could be measured in hit points (HP). 

HP Calculations: 

- Start with a base health value of 20, representing the character's starting health.

- Add 1 health point for every 2 points of musculature, representing the character's raw physical power and ability to take damage. So a character with 4 musculature would have an additional 2 health points, for a total of 22.

- Multiply the character's base health by a factor based on their tenacity skill. For example, you could multiply base health by (1 + (tenacity / 20)), meaning that a character with 6 points in tenacity would have a 15% bonus to their base health, while a character with 10 points in tenacity would have a 25% bonus to their base health.

--Example Basis - So a character with 3 points in each attribute and 4 points in tenacity would have a base health value of 20, and could potentially have up to 6 additional health points from musculature (assuming they put all 7 of their remaining points into musculature). However, their actual health value would be increased by the tenacity bonus, so if we assume they have a base health value of 20, then their actual health value would be 25 (20 x 1.25).
