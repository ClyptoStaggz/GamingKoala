This stat represents the player's raw physical power and ability to deal devastating melee attacks. A high musculature stat means that the player can hit harder and break through enemy defenses more easily.
This attribute is on a scale of 0-11, where 0 represents a character with very little physical strength and 11 represents a character who can lift massive weights and deal devastating blows.

The formula for base melee damage would be:

base melee damage = musculature stat value * 2

So for a player with a musculature stat of 3, their melee damage would be:

base melee damage = 3 * 2
base melee damage = 6
