Aenima pool: This sub-attribute represents the character's ability to use special abilities or powers. The Aenima pool could be based on the character's potential stat, and could be used to cast spells, activate abilities, or perform other special actions. The Aenima pool could be measured in Aenima points (AP).

- Start with a base Aenima pool value of 10, representing the character's starting energy reserve.

- Add 1 Aenima point for every 2 points of potential, representing the character's ability to harness their abilities and deal damage. 

- So a character with 4 potential would get an additional 2 Aenima points, for a total of 12.

- Add bonus Aenima points from equipment or abilities.

- Multiply the character's base Aenima pool by a factor based on their kinematics skill. For example, you could multiply base Aenima pool by (1 + (kinematics / 10)), meaning that a character with 6 points in kinematics would have a 20% bonus to their base Aenima pool, while a character with 10 points in kinematics would have a 50% bonus to their base Aenima pool.
So a character with 3 points in each attribute and 4 points in potential would have a base Aenima pool value of 10, and could potentially have up to 12 Aenima points at character creation (assuming they put all 7 of their remaining points into potential). However, their actual Aenima pool would be increased by the kinematics bonus, so if we assume they have a base Aenima pool of 10, then their actual Aenima pool would be 15 (10 x 1.5).
