Stamina: This sub-attribute represents how much physical exertion the character can endure before becoming fatigued. You could give the character a base amount of stamina determined by their musculature and kinematics stats, and then add more stamina based on their level and any equipment or abilities they have. Stamina could be measured in stamina points (SP).

Stamina Calculations: 

- Start with a base stamina value of 10, representing the character's starting endurance.

- Add 1 stamina point for every 2 points of kinematics, representing the character's agility and mobility. So a character with 4 kinematics would get an additional 2 stamina points, for a total of 12.

- Add 1 stamina point for every 2 points of musculature, representing the character's physical power and stamina. So a character with 4 musculature would get an additional 2 stamina points, for a total of 14.

- Add bonus stamina points from equipment or abilities.

- Multiply the character's base stamina by a factor based on their reconstruction skill. For example, you could multiply base stamina by (1 + (reconstruction / 10)), meaning that a character with 6 points in reconstruction would have a 20% bonus to their base stamina, while a character with 10 points in reconstruction would have a 50% bonus to their base stamina.


--Example Basis - So a character with 3 points in each attribute and 4 points in reconstruction would have a base stamina value of 10, and could potentially have up to 14 stamina points at character creation (assuming they put 4 points into both kinematics and musculature, and didn't allocate any points elsewhere). However, their actual stamina pool would be increased by the reconstruction bonus, so if we assume they have a base stamina of 10, then their actual stamina pool would be 15 (10 x 1.5).
