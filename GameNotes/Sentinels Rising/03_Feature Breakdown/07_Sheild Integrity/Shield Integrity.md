When the player is Blocking attacks or holds their shield;  Their shield will deplete based on a basic value over time while activated and in addition to any damage taken.  When the player's shield depletes, the player will become stunned and can not react for a brief moment. They will need to wait a certain amount of time until they can use it again. This is called a full recharge. 

Regeneration on the shield is under the two following conditions: 
 - The shield will slowly regenerate while the player is not using it and is not taking damage.  Reconstruction stat will also constitute to a bonus in regeneration time. 
 - The shield has been depleted and must reach full recharge before it can be activated again. The cooldown time on this can be reduced with higher stat levels of reconstruction.
