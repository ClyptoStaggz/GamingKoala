Once an enemy has taken enough damage, the player will be able to rush towards and absorb them through a Quick Time Event (QTE). All incoming damage is negated during the assimilation. (iframes) In order to perform this on normal enemies, they must be at 20% health or lower. In order to perform this on Lieutenants, Captains. You will need to deplete their health completely. The rate at which the enemy is assimilated varies.



- Do Lieutenants, Captains, and Generals (becuase they need to have their health drained completely) have a little bit of health given back to them after the QTE window closes?
		- Yes
	-Can the player still kill the Lieutenants, Captains, and Generals and not Assimilate (Do the QTE)?
- What does Assimilation do for the player?
	- It has been said that this is how the player learns abilities; if this is the case, assign which ability will be learned from which enemy
	- How does the player know they've done well with the Assimilation? Without UI are we stopping Combat to grant the player an ability? 
	- Suggestion: The player earns a load of Ã¦nima chips instead. The player needs to make it back to the Nexus in order to spend the currency on upgrading their suit/unlocking these abilities instead. Keeping the theme of "The player is changing and upgrading their suit from the Nexus". (Think blood points in the earlier GOW games)
- Do Lieutenants, Captians, and Generals have different QTEs?
	- What are the QTEs the player needs to complete?
	- What happens if the player doesn't complete the QTE? What are the failure states?
- Visuals of Assimilation
	- Suggestion: Prototype?
