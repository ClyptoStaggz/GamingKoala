 
## Overview
The player will be able to enter and exit this movement mode while Sprinting, using either a controller's LeftTrigger or Shift on the keyboard. In order to initiate the ADS, the player will need to hold down either button for 3 seconds. After the ADS is active, they can release the button, maintaining the ADS mode.
