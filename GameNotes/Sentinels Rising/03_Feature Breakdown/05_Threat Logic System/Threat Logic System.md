All characters in the game will be compared to one another through the Threat Level System, (TL/TLS) rather than visually representing numbered levels. The TLS is a means to measure the players overall lethality and combat strength. Each ability will have a certain amount of points that contribute to the players overall TL. Each time a player increases one of their abilities, they increase their TL by a predetermined amount. Each enemy the player encounters will have an indication of their threat level and give the player a slight understanding of what to expect when engaging them.

The TLS system will also be the combat algorithm used by the AI combat directors within the game to coordinate combat situations against the player to make each engagement unique to their playstyle, equipment and various other factors that we are to determine as this system develops more.
