All characters in the game will be compared to one another through the Threat Level System, (TL/TLS) rather than visually representing numbered levels. The TLS is a means to measure the players overall lethality and combat strength. Each ability will have a certain amount of points that contribute to the players overall TL. Each time a player increases one of their abilities, they increase their TL by a predetermined amount. Each enemy the player encounters will have an indication of their threat level and give the player a slight understanding of what to expect when engaging them.

The TLS system will also be the combat algorithm used by the AI combat directors within the game to coordinate combat situations against the player to make each engagement unique to their playstyle, equipment and various other factors that we are to determine as this system develops more. 

TLS Features/Characteristics

1. Adaptive Behavior: Implement AI characters that can adapt their behavior based on changing circumstances. For example, create NPCs that can dynamically switch between different tactics or strategies based on the player's actions or the state of the game world.
	1. Define Behaviors and Strategies: Identify a set of behaviors and strategies that your AI characters can employ. These can include offensive, defensive, evasive, or cooperative tactics, as well as different strategies for different game situations.
    
	2. Perception and Situational Awareness: Implement an AI perception system that allows AI characters to perceive and understand the game world. This can involve sensing the player's actions, environmental changes, or the presence of other AI characters. Use this information to build situational awareness.
    
	3. Decision-Making Framework: Develop a decision-making framework that considers the current situation, AI character capabilities, and available tactics. This can involve using behavior trees, rule-based systems, or state machines to determine the most appropriate behavior or strategy for a given circumstance.
    
	4. Behavior Switching: Create a mechanism for AI characters to dynamically switch between different behaviors or strategies based on changing circumstances. This can be triggered by specific events, the player's actions, changes in the game environment, or even the AI character's health or energy levels.
    
	5. Learning and Adaptation: Incorporate learning mechanisms into your AI system to enable AI characters to adapt their behavior over time. This can involve using machine learning algorithms, such as reinforcement learning, to learn from the player's actions or the outcomes of their tactics and adjust their behavior accordingly.
    
	6. Testing and Balancing: Thoroughly playtest and balance the adaptive AI system to ensure that the AI characters respond appropriately to different situations and that their adaptive behavior enhances gameplay depth and challenge.
    
	7. Documentation and Showcase: Document the design and implementation of the adaptive AI system, emphasizing the innovation, uniqueness, and applicability to your game project. Showcase how the AI characters' adaptive behavior enhances player engagement, replayability, and overall gameplay experience.
2. Team-based AI: Create AI systems that involve collaboration and coordination among multiple AI characters. Design AI teammates that can communicate, strategize, and work together effectively to achieve shared objectives.
	1. 1. Define Team Roles: Start by defining specific roles for each AI teammate within the team. Roles can include a leader, attacker, defender, supporter, or any other role relevant to your game's mechanics and objectives.
    
	2. Communication System: Implement a communication system that allows AI teammates to exchange information and coordinate their actions. This can involve message passing, event signaling, or other forms of communication to share information about targets, positions, threats, or strategies.
    
	3. Strategic Decision-making: Design an AI decision-making system that enables teammates to assess the situation, evaluate objectives, and strategize collaboratively. This can involve algorithms such as finite state machines, behavior trees, or rule-based systems to determine the best course of action based on the team's goals and current circumstances.
    
	4. Tactical Coordination: Implement mechanisms that facilitate tactical coordination among AI teammates. This can include synchronized attacks, flanking maneuvers, covering fire, or other coordinated actions to outmaneuver opponents or achieve shared objectives. Pathfinding algorithms and spatial awareness can assist in navigating the environment together effectively.
    
	5. Shared Objectives: Define shared objectives for the AI team and ensure that each teammate contributes to the team's overall goal. This can involve capturing objectives, defending positions, escorting allies, or any other cooperative gameplay mechanics that align with your game's design.
    
	6. Adaptive Behavior: Implement adaptive behavior in AI teammates to account for changing situations and adapt their strategies accordingly. They should respond dynamically to the actions of other teammates, the player, and the game environment.
    
	7. Playtesting and Balancing: Thoroughly playtest the team-based AI system to ensure it provides engaging and challenging gameplay. Balance the AI teammates' abilities, coordination, and decision-making to provide an enjoyable experience for players.
    
	8. AI vs. Player Interaction: Consider how the team-based AI system interacts with the player. It could involve creating challenging and dynamic encounters where the player must strategize and counter the AI team's coordinated actions.
3. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment: Develop AI systems that dynamically adjust the game's difficulty based on player performance or behavior. Demonstrate how the AI system can provide tailored challenges to players and adapt the gameplay experience to their skill level.
	1. 1. Define Difficulty Factors: Identify the key factors that contribute to the game's difficulty. These factors can include enemy strength, player skill, time limits, puzzle complexity, or any other relevant gameplay element.
    
	2. Collect Player Data: Implement a mechanism to collect data about the player's performance and behavior. This data can be gathered through various means such as player actions, completion times, scores, or even physiological responses if applicable.
    
	3. Analyze Player Data: Analyze the collected player data to gain insights into the player's performance and skill level. This analysis can involve statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, or rule-based systems to understand the player's behavior patterns and skill progression.
    
	4. Adjust Difficulty Parameters: Based on the analyzed player data, dynamically adjust the difficulty parameters in real-time. These parameters can be related to enemy AI behavior, enemy strength, spawn rates, puzzle complexity, or any other relevant aspect of the game that affects difficulty.
    
	5. Feedback and Balancing: Provide feedback to the player about the difficulty adjustments being made. Communicate the changes transparently and ensure that the game remains challenging yet enjoyable. Continuously evaluate and fine-tune the difficulty balancing based on player feedback and playtesting.
    
	6. Difficulty Modes: Consider offering different difficulty modes that players can choose from, such as easy, medium, and hard. Allow players to manually override the dynamic difficulty adjustment if they prefer a specific level of challenge.
    
	7. Personalization and Progression: As the player progresses through the game, consider adapting the difficulty to match their skill level and provide an appropriate level of challenge. Provide opportunities for player growth and learning, allowing them to gradually improve their skills.
