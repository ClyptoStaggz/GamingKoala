The player will learn about new abilities through Assimilating enemies. Once the player has learned abilities, they begin to improve those abilities through using them and then taking advancement tests at the Research Facility. Each ability starts out with the rank of F and works to rank A then 5 to 1. Each time the player ranks up an ability, they get a permanent boost to their Player Stats. The abilities will become more efficient and deadly when they hit rank D, A, 3 and 1.

- Could the player simply use the abiltiy and still max out the rank of the abilities? Without going to the Research Facility 
	- Player will need to repeatedly assimilate with the same enemies in order to level up the abilities
		- As Assimilation happens, a the suit starts to collect the Ability's DNA, gets Emptied into a vial back at the Nexus
		- Emptying the vial at the Nexus
		- As more vials are collected, the DNA will become more powerful and concentrated. 
			- F through 1 Leveling system 
			- All the same Stat boosts are at the same points
- Enemies in Sectors will be tied to Elements

# Perfect Counter
The player will be able to perform a counter by Blocking a Light/Heavy Attack precisely as the attack is supposed to land on the player. Performing a counter on Light/Heavy Attacks will cause a burst of energy to damage enemies in a small cone in front of the player. The player will send projectiles back to the enemy that fired it. The player can not counter Unblockable Attacks.

# Assault Slash
The player will be able to perform an assault slash on the enemy with a Light Attack precisely after the player performs a Perfect Dodge. The player dashes back to the enemy and critically strikes them for a large amount of damage.
