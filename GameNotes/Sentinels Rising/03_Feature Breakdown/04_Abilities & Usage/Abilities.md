rThe player will learn about new abilities through Assimilating enemies. 
Once the player has learned abilities, they begin to improve those abilities through using them and assimilating more of the same creature to absorb and cleanse it of the fungal mutation. 



Each side of the helix represents a part of this process. 
The Red side will be assimilation progress of the creature.

	Thresholds will be set for each rank as to how many culminatively have been assimilated. 


The Blue side will be usage of the ability.  
	This will increase on a per usage basis of the ability.  ( similar to weapon abilities from *Legend of Dragoon ( ref)* *)


Each ability starts out with the rank of F and works to rank A then 5 to 1. Each time the player ranks up an ability, they get a permanent boost to their Player Stats. The abilities will become more efficient and deadly when they hit rank D, A, 3 and 1.
