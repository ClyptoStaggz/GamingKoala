Ability Name: Mirror Image

Type: Utility

Effect: Mirror Image allows the player to create a convincing duplicate of themselves, which serves as a decoy to divert enemy fire and attention. Upon activation, a mirror image of the player is generated, mimicking their appearance and movement. The duplicate runs in the targeted direction, effectively drawing enemy fire and diverting attention away from the player, providing a valuable distraction on the battlefield.

Scaling: As Mirror Image ranks up, the decoy becomes more durable and resilient, able to withstand enemy attacks for a longer duration before dissipating. The increased durability of the decoy enhances its effectiveness in drawing enemy fire and diverting attention, providing the player with more tactical advantages. Additionally, at higher ranks, the player gains additional charges of Mirror Image, allowing them to create multiple decoys and further confuse their enemies.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Mirror Image offers players a strategic utility ability that provides both defensive and offensive benefits. By ranking up this ability, players can create more resilient decoys, prolonging their effectiveness in drawing enemy fire and distracting opponents. The ability to generate multiple decoys at higher ranks adds further versatility, enabling players to confuse and confound their adversaries with a greater number of diversionary tactics. Mirror Image is an excellent choice for players who enjoy tactical maneuvering, misdirection, and creating opportunities for advantageous positioning or surprise attacks.
