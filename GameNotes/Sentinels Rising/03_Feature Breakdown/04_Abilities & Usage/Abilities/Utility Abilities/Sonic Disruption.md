- Ability Name: Sonic Disruption

Type: Debuff

Effect: The user emits a powerful roar that shakes the ground and creates a shockwave that hits all enemies within range. Upon impact, enemies are affected by a slowing debuff, reducing their movement speed and reaction time. This debuff hampers their ability to dodge attacks and maneuver effectively in combat.

Scaling: As the ability ranks up, the area of effect (AOE) of the shockwave expands, allowing the user to affect a larger number of enemies within the radius. Additionally, the duration of the slow debuff increases, prolonging the enemies' impaired movement and reaction speed.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Sonic Disruption provides players with a strategic choice for crowd control and battlefield manipulation. The ability allows players to disrupt groups of enemies, hindering their mobility and granting the player a tactical advantage. By ranking up Sonic Disruption, players can expand the area of effect, potentially affecting more enemies at once, and prolong the duration of the debuff, maximizing the impact on enemy movement. This ability is particularly useful for players who prefer controlling the battlefield, setting up combos, or creating opportunities for their team members to follow up with devastating attacks.
