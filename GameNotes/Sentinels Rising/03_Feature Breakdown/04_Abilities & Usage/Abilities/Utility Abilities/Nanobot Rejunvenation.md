Ability Name: Nanobot Rejuvenation

Type: Healing

Effect: Nanobot Rejuvenation administers a potent dose of healing nanobots into the targeted user or a single ally. The nanobots work continuously to restore a moderate amount of HP over time, gradually replenishing the health of the recipient. In addition to the restorative effect, Nanobot Rejuvenation provides a temporary boost to the target's regenerative abilities, enhancing their natural healing capabilities for the duration of the effect.

Scaling: As Nanobot Rejuvenation ranks up, both the healing and regenerative effects become more potent. The restorative power of the nanobots increases, resulting in a faster rate of HP recovery for the affected ally. The boost to regenerative abilities becomes more pronounced, amplifying the target's innate healing potential and further bolstering their ability to recover from injuries.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Nanobot Rejuvenation offers players a versatile healing ability that combines gradual HP restoration with an added regenerative boost. By ranking up this ability, players can ensure a more rapid healing process, enabling the target to recover from injuries at an accelerated rate. The enhanced regenerative effect provides a valuable advantage, allowing the recipient to heal more efficiently and sustain themselves in battle. Nanobot Rejuvenation is an excellent choice for players who prioritize long-term sustainability and seek to optimize their healing capabilities.
