Also, locking the player into ADS might take them too far away from the fight if they were intending to stay in it. %%

Ability Name: RipCord

Type: Utility

Effect: RipCord grants the player a swift and evasive maneuver, propelling them forward while engaging ADS (Aim Down Sights) mode. Upon activation, the player rapidly projects themselves forward, gaining increased mobility and the benefits of ADS. This ability provides invaluable invincibility frames (iframes) for emergency exits from combat situations, allowing the player to avoid incoming damage and escape dangerous encounters. However, after engaging RipCord, there is a 10-second window (scaleable) where the player remains committed to ADS mode, limiting their offensive capabilities during that period.

Scaling: As RipCord ranks up, the invulnerability window provided by the iframes is increased, allowing the player to safely navigate through prolonged periods of intense combat. This extended invincibility duration offers players more flexibility and a greater margin of safety when utilizing RipCord as a defensive escape mechanism.

Explanation for Player Decisions: RipCord empowers players with a reliable and swift means of disengaging from dangerous combat scenarios. By ranking up this ability, players can enjoy a more extended period of invincibility frames, ensuring a safer escape and reducing the risk of sustaining damage while making their retreat. RipCord's combination of mobility and temporary invulnerability makes it a valuable choice for players who prioritize survivability and calculated tactical retreats.
