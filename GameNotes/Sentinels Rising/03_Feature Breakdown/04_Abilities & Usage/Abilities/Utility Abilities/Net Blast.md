Ability Name: Net Blast

Type: Crowd Control

Effect: Net Blast unleashes a powerful burst of energy that creates an entangling net, ensnaring and immobilizing all enemies within a certain radius. The net wraps around the affected enemies, rendering them unable to move or take any action for the duration of the ensnare effect.

Scaling: As Net Blast ranks up, the radius of the ensnare effect expands, allowing the player to trap a larger number of enemies within its area of influence. Additionally, the duration of the ensnare effect increases, prolonging the immobilization and providing the player and their allies with an extended window of opportunity to capitalize on the disabled enemies.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Net Blast offers players a valuable crowd control tool to temporarily neutralize a group of enemies and hinder their combat capabilities. By ranking up Net Blast, players can expand the radius of the ensnare effect, increasing the area in which enemies can be immobilized, providing greater control over the battlefield. The longer duration of the ensnare effect at higher ranks grants players and their allies more time to execute coordinated strategies, unleash devastating attacks, or reposition themselves for a tactical advantage. This ability is particularly advantageous for players who prefer to control enemy movement and create opportunities for their team to deal damage or gain positional advantages.
