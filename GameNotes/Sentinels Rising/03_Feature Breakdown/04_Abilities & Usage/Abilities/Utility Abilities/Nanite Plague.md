Ability Name: Nanite Plague

Type: Debuff

Effect: Nanite Plague unleashes a cloud of nanobots in an area-of-effect, infecting enemies within its radius. These nanobots induce a state of confusion among affected enemies, causing them to attack their own allies instead of the player or their allies. This leads to enemy forces turning against each other, creating chaos and reducing their overall effectiveness in combat.

Scaling: As Nanite Plague ranks up, the debuff becomes more potent. The confusion effect becomes stronger, increasing the likelihood of enemies attacking each other and potentially causing more significant damage. Additionally, the cloud's area of coverage expands, allowing the player to affect a larger number of enemies within the vicinity.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Nanite Plague provides players with a powerful crowd control option that disrupts enemy formations and turns their own strength against them. Players can strategically deploy Nanite Plague in the midst of enemy groups to sow confusion and disarray among their ranks. Ranking up the ability enhances the potency of the confusion effect, increasing the chances of enemies inflicting significant damage to their own allies. Additionally, the larger area of effect at higher ranks enables players to influence a greater number of enemies, maximizing the potential chaos on the battlefield. This ability is particularly valuable for players who excel in crowd control tactics and prefer to create strategic advantages through enemy disunity.
