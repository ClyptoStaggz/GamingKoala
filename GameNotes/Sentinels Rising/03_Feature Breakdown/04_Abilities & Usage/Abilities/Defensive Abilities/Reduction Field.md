Ability Name: Reduction Field

Type: Defensive

Effect: Reduction Field empowers the player to create a protective forcefield at a targeted destination. Within this forcefield, any entities, including the player and allies, are rendered impervious to ranged attacks and abilities. The Reduction Field serves as a powerful defensive zone, providing a sanctuary against incoming projectiles and long-range assaults. Enemies attempting to attack from a distance will find their attacks nullified and ineffective within the boundaries of the forcefield.

Scaling: As Reduction Field ranks up, the duration of the field's existence increases, granting a more extended period of protection for the player and their allies. The increased duration allows for more strategic positioning and tactical advantages during combat engagements. Additionally, at higher ranks, the forcefield's durability, represented by its hit points (HP), increases, ensuring that it remains resilient against sustained assaults. This durability enhancement guarantees a reliable defense against a wide range of ranged attacks and abilities.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Reduction Field provides players with a potent defensive tool to create safe zones on the battlefield. By ranking up this ability, players can establish larger and more resilient forcefields, granting an extended duration of protection for themselves and their allies. The increased hit points of the forcefield further bolster its effectiveness, ensuring that it can withstand a significant amount of ranged attacks and abilities. Reduction Field is an excellent choice for players who seek to control the battlefield, create strategic opportunities, and protect their team from long-range threats.
