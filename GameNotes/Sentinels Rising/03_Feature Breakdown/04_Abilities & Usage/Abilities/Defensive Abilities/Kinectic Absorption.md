Ability Name: Kinetic Absorption

Type: Defensive

Effect: Kinetic Absorption empowers the player to absorb incoming damage up to a predetermined threshold. This does not prevent the player from taking damage, but instead takes the incoming damage values and "stores them". Upon activation, the player's defensive capabilities are enhanced, allowing them to absorb a certain amount of damage before reaching the threshold. Once the threshold is met, the absorbed energy is released in a powerful repulsive blast, forcefully pushing back all nearby enemies and creating a temporary zone of safety.

Scaling: As Kinetic Absorption ranks up, the threshold for damage absorption is lowered, allowing the player to withstand a greater amount of incoming damage before triggering the repulsive blast. The increased threshold provides players with enhanced durability and a longer window to absorb attacks. Additionally, at higher ranks, the repulsive blast becomes more potent, resulting in a larger and more forceful pushback of enemies, creating greater crowd control effects and creating more distance between the player and their adversaries.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Kinetic Absorption is an excellent defensive ability that enables players to withstand incoming damage and create a momentary advantage in combat. By ranking up this ability, players can absorb more damage, granting them increased survivability and the ability to endure onslaughts for longer periods. The heightened repulsive blast at higher ranks provides a powerful crowd control effect, pushing back enemies and creating breathing room for strategic repositioning or regrouping. Kinetic Absorption is a valuable choice for players who value resilience, crowd control, and the ability to turn enemy attacks into defensive opportunities.
