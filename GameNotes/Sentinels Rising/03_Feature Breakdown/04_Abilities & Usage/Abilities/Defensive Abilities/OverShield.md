Ability Name: Overshield

Type: Defensive

Effect: Overshield empowers the player to construct a protective barrier that encompasses themselves and all allies in battle. This barrier acts as an overshield, providing an additional layer of health to absorb incoming damage. The overshield remains active for a duration determined by its shield health, serving as a temporary buffer against enemy assaults.

Scaling: As Overshield ranks up, the shielding capacity of the barrier increases. This higher shielding capacity allows the overshield to absorb more damage, providing enhanced protection to the player and their allies. The increased durability of the barrier ensures that it remains effective for a more extended period, granting prolonged defense during intense engagements.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Overshield presents players with a powerful defensive ability that strengthens their entire team. By ranking up this ability, players can create larger and more resilient overshields, granting substantial additional health to all allies in battle. The increased shielding capacity ensures that the overshield remains effective for a longer duration, bolstering the team's survivability and resilience in the face of enemy attacks. Overshield is an excellent choice for players who prioritize team support, providing a crucial defensive advantage to turn the tide of battles and protect their comrades.
