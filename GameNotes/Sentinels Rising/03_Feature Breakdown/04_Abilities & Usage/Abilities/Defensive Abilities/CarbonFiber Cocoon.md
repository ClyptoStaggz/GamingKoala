Ability Name: CarbonFiber Cocoon

Type: Defensive

Effect: CarbonFiber Cocoon enables the player to activate a defensive mechanism within the exosuit, enveloping themselves in a protective cocoon of hardened carbon fiber. While inside the cocoon, incoming damage is significantly reduced for a duration of time or until the player decides to move, providing a temporary shield against enemy assaults. While in the cocoon, the ability plates will recharge at a rate that will be determined

Scaling: As CarbonFiber Cocoon ranks up, the effectiveness of the defensive cocoon improves. The reduction in incoming damage becomes more pronounced, allowing the player to withstand even the most powerful enemy attacks. At higher ranks, an additional benefit is unlocked: once the duration of the cocoon expires or the player chooses to move, a residual shielding effect remains in place. This residual shielding provides a brief period of continued damage reduction, offering a momentary buffer against incoming attacks while transitioning out of the cocoon.

Explanation for Player Decisions: CarbonFiber Cocoon offers players a valuable defensive ability that grants temporary invulnerability to incoming damage. By ranking up this ability, players can rely on a more potent cocoon that provides enhanced protection, allowing them to weather intense enemy assaults and survive in challenging situations. The added benefit of residual shielding after the cocoon dissipates adds an extra layer of strategic advantage, enabling players to maintain a defensive advantage even after leaving the cocoon. CarbonFiber Cocoon is an excellent choice for players seeking a reliable defensive tool to mitigate damage and turn the tide of battles.
