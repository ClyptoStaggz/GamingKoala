Ability Name: Barrier

Type: Defensive

Effect: Barrier grants the player the ability to take cover behind an Energy-Based barrier, providing a reliable defense against incoming attacks. Upon activation, the player positions themselves strategically behind the barrier, gaining the ability to reflect all incoming damage back to anything situated behind the barrier. This defensive stance allows the player to effectively redirect enemy projectiles and attacks, turning the tables on their adversaries and utilizing the environment to their advantage.

Scaling: As Barrier ranks up, the durability of the constructed barrier increases, enabling it to withstand a greater amount of incoming damage. The enhanced durability ensures that the barrier remains intact and functional for a more extended period, providing the player with prolonged defensive coverage and an increased window of opportunity to reflect enemy attacks. The scaling primarily focuses on reinforcing the defensive capabilities of the barrier, making it a more reliable shield against various forms of incoming damage.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Barrier offers players a robust defensive ability that allows them to turn enemy attacks against their foes. By ranking up this ability, players can rely on a more resilient barrier, capable of withstanding a greater onslaught of damage before succumbing. The increased durability of the barrier provides players with extended periods of effective defense and the ability to effectively reflect incoming damage, providing a unique tactical advantage. Barrier is an ideal choice for players who prefer a defensive playstyle, using calculated positioning and environmental elements to gain the upper hand in combat.
