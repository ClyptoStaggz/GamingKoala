%%Suggestion: When the player activates this ability, they send out a small AOE blast upon landing to stun enemies and allow the overshield to solidify/charge up before getting attacked

Ability Name: Rescue

Type: Defensive

Effect: Rescue empowers the player with the ability to swiftly leap to an ally's aid, providing immediate support and protection. Upon activation, the player will perform a dynamic leap, closing the distance to the targeted ally. Both the player and the targeted ally, if friendly, are granted an overshield upon landing. This overshield serves as an additional layer of protection, absorbing incoming damage for a limited duration.

Scaling: As Rescue ranks up, the distance covered during the leap increases, allowing the player to reach allies who may be further away. The enhanced reach ensures that the player can swiftly respond to critical situations across the battlefield. Additionally, the strength of the overshield improves with each rank, providing a greater capacity to absorb damage and safeguard the player and their ally from harm.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Rescue is a valuable defensive ability that emphasizes the player's role as a supportive team member. By ranking up Rescue, players can effectively respond to allies in need, quickly reaching them and granting an overshield for added protection. The increased leap distance enables the player to cover greater distances, ensuring that no ally is out of reach in critical moments. Moreover, the scaling improvements to the overshield's strength make Rescue even more effective, bolstering the defensive capabilities of both the player and their ally. Rescue is an excellent choice for players who prioritize team synergy and providing immediate assistance on the battlefield.
