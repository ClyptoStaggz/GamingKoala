Ability Name: Undying

Type: Defensive

Effect: Undying grants the player the ability to endure fatal blows by entering a state of critical damage for a limited duration. While in this state, the player cannot be killed, ensuring their survival even in the face of overwhelming damage. However, once the duration of the Undying state ends, the accumulated damage remains, and the player returns to a vulnerable state, where they can be defeated by subsequent attacks. This ability acts the same as a Berserker ability.

Scaling: As Undying ranks up, the duration of the critical damage state lengthens. This extended duration allows the player to withstand lethal assaults for a more extended period, providing additional opportunities for strategic maneuvers or turning the tide of battle. It is important to note that while Undying prevents immediate death, it does not negate the accumulated damage, meaning the player will still need to address their injuries and seek healing or defensive measures once the Undying state concludes.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Undying is a unique defensive ability that offers a temporary reprieve from death, allowing players to endure lethal situations and potentially turn the tables on their opponents. By ranking up Undying, players can prolong the duration of their critical damage state, affording them more time to recover, retaliate, or seek assistance from allies. It is crucial to utilize this ability strategically, understanding that the accumulated damage will still need to be addressed once the Undying state ends. Undying is an excellent choice for players who enjoy high-risk, high-reward gameplay and value the ability to survive dire situations.
