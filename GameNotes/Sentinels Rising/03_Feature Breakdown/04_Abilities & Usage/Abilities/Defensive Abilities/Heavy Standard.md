Ability Name: Heavy Standard

Type: Defensive

Effect: Heavy Standard empowers the player with unwavering resilience and damage reduction. Upon activation, the player becomes impervious to flinching, allowing them to maintain their position and focus even when subjected to enemy attacks. Simultaneously, a potent damage reduction effect is applied to incoming damage, reducing the harm inflicted upon the player during the ability's duration.

Scaling: As Heavy Standard ranks up, the duration of the ability is extended, granting the player a more prolonged period of uninterrupted resilience and damage reduction. The increased duration allows players to withstand sustained assaults and maintain their offensive or defensive strategies with confidence. Additionally, at higher ranks, the damage reduction effect becomes more potent, further decreasing the amount of damage taken from enemy attacks, ensuring the player's survivability even in the face of formidable foes.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Heavy Standard offers players a formidable defensive tool, allowing them to stand their ground and shrug off incoming attacks. By ranking up this ability, players can enjoy an extended duration of invulnerability to flinching, providing an uninterrupted focus on their actions. The increased damage reduction at higher ranks significantly bolsters the player's survivability, allowing them to withstand heavy onslaughts and emerge victorious in challenging encounters. Heavy Standard is an excellent choice for players who prioritize resilience and maintaining control of the battlefield.
