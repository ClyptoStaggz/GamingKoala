The player will learn about new abilities through Assimilating enemies. 
Once the player has learned abilities, they begin to improve those abilities through using them and assimilating more of the same creature to absorb and cleanse it of the fungal mutation. 


Each side of the helix represents a part of this process. 
The Orange side will be assimilation progress of the creature.

	Thresholds will be set for each rank as to how many culminatively have been assimilated. 


The Blue side will be usage of the ability.  
	This will increase on a per usage basis of the ability.  ( similar to weapon abilities from *Legend of Dragoon ( ref)* *)

The Green Nodes (Ability nodes) will be the progression ranks of the ability. 

As each side aligns, it will light up the corresponding side of the node. Both sides must be lit in order for the ability node to activate. 

![[abilityhelix1 1.jpg]]


Each ability starts out with the progression rank of 1 and works to rank 12.

Abilities will have 12 ranks. 4 major ranks, starting at 1 the player will have increases to the capabilities of the ability every 4th rank. example : 1 4 8 12

Each time the player activates an ability node, they will acquire the effect of this node. Some nodes  ( 3,7,11 ) will be permanent affixes to the players stats even with the ability unequipped. 

### Ability node Template ( TBD)

- Could the player simply use the ability and still max out the rank of the abilities? Without going to the Research Facility 
	- Player will need to repeatedly assimilate with the same enemies in order to level up the abilities
		- As Assimilation happens, a the suit starts to collect the Ability's DNA, gets Emptied into a vial back at the Nexus
		- Emptying the vial at the Nexus
		- As more vials are collected, the DNA will become more powerful and concentrated. 
			- 0-1 through 12 Leveling system ( player is zero until acquisition of ability)
			- All the same Stat boosts are at the same points

- Visuals, Storyboarding,
