Ability Name: Laser Storm

Type: Damage

Effect: With Laser Storm, the player unleashes a powerful display of destructive energy. The ability begins by hurling a large disc into the air, creating anticipation and drawing the attention of enemies. As the disc reaches its apex, the player pulls back, charging energy within their exosuit. With precision timing, they release a devastating blast of concentrated energy directly beneath the disc, resulting in a cataclysmic explosion that engulfs enemies in its path.

Scaling: As the ranks of Laser Storm increase, its impact on the battlefield becomes even more formidable. At higher ranks, the player gains the ability to hit a larger number of enemies with the devastating blast. This expanded area of effect ensures that a greater number of foes can be caught within the destructive force of the explosion, maximizing the damage potential of Laser Storm. Additionally, the range of the blast expands with each rank, allowing players to target enemies at a greater distance and unleash devastation across a wider area.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Laser Storm offers players an explosive and visually impressive damage ability. The sequence of launching the disc into the air and then unleashing the devastating blast creates a sense of anticipation and strategic timing. Players can strategically position the disc and choose the ideal moment to release the powerful blast, maximizing its impact on their enemies. The ability's scaling mechanics reward players as they rank up, granting them the ability to hit more enemies and expanding the range of destruction. With Laser Storm, players can rain down devastation upon their foes, decimating groups of enemies and asserting their dominance on the battlefield.
