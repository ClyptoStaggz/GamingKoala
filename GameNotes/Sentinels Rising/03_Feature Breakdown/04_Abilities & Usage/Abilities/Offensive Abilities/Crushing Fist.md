%%Does the player have to lock onto a target first to use this ability? Or will the ability automatically chose an enemy in front of the player to attack?
Can this ability be activated in the air from using ADS? If so, would need further clarification on the above and what visuals the player will need to see so they can more accurately place this attack%%

Ability Name: Crushing Fist

Type: Damage

Effect: Crushing Fist is a powerful offensive ability that showcases the player's mastery over nanobots. When activated, the player leaps into the air, summoning a swarm of nanobots that gather around their fist. With tremendous force, the player then crashes down onto a single target, unleashing the destructive power of the nanobots upon impact. The nanobots not only deal significant damage to the primary target but also inflict damage to surrounding enemies within a certain area, thanks to their explosive impact.

Scaling: As Crushing Fist ranks up, the potency of its impact damage and the area of effect are enhanced. The nanobots become more efficient in causing destruction, resulting in more devastating damage to the primary target and a wider area of effect to secondary targets. The scaling ensures that as the player progresses and becomes more skilled, Crushing Fist becomes an even more formidable and effective tool for dealing damage. It becomes a centerpiece ability for unleashing devastating blows upon enemies and clearing out groups of foes with its powerful nanobot swarm.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Choosing Crushing Fist allows players to harness the destructive power of nanobots and deliver devastating blows to their foes. This ability combines mobility and damage, providing an exciting playstyle that emphasizes precise timing and positioning. The scaling of Crushing Fist ensures that players who invest in this ability will witness its continuous growth in both impact damage and area of effect, making it increasingly potent and efficient as they progress. By selecting Crushing Fist, players can unleash powerful nanobot-infused strikes, wreak havoc among enemies, and dominate the battlefield with sheer force.
