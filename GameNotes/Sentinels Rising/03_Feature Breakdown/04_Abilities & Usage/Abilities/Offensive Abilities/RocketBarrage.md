Ability Name: Rocket Barrage

Type: Damage

Effect: With Rocket Barrage, the player harnesses the power of explosive rockets to rain devastation upon their foes. Upon activation, the player propels themselves into the air, reaching a significant vertical height. From this elevated position, they unleash a barrage of rockets that lock onto a single targeted area. The rockets track the designated location, descending upon it with explosive force upon impact, dealing damage to enemies caught within the blast radius.

Scaling: As the ranks of Rocket Barrage increase, the rockets become more powerful and deadly. The speed at which the rockets travel towards their target increases, making them harder to evade. Additionally, the explosive power of the rockets amplifies, resulting in greater damage upon impact. This scaling mechanism enables players to become more effective in dealing damage with Rocket Barrage, ensuring that it remains a formidable offensive ability throughout their progression.

Explanation for Player Decisions: Choosing Rocket Barrage grants players a devastating long-range option, allowing them to rain down explosive destruction upon their enemies. The ability to launch a barrage of tracking rockets provides excellent area denial and crowd control, making it particularly effective against groups of enemies or stationary targets. As players invest in Rocket Barrage and advance its ranks, they unlock faster rockets that are harder to dodge, and the increased damage ensures that the ability remains impactful even as they face stronger adversaries. Whether players prefer a strategic bombardment approach or enjoy the thrill of explosive chaos, Rocket Barrage offers a satisfying damage-dealing ability.
