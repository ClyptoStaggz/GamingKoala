The player will be able to perform a block during combat that will prevent damage from most attacks at the cost of your Shield Integrity. The player will need to press and hold down a console controller's LeftBumper in order to start blocking. Letting go of the LeftBumper will cause the player to stop blocking. Unblockable Attacks will instantly break your shield and cause damage to the player. Holding the block for too long will deplete the Shield Integrity. Blocking Light Attacks will not cause the player to stop their Movement. Blocking Heavy Attacks will cause the player to briefly stop their Movement.
